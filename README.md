# Component-Tester
This is an automatic Transistor Tester, to identify pinout and characteristics of various discrete semiconductors ( Transistors NPN, PNP, MOSFETs, etc ). It's also evaluating resistors, capacitors, inductances, etc... The original project was written in a mix of C and AVR Assembly Code for AVR gcc tooling AVR Studio.
