# Component-Tester
This is an automatic Transistor Tester, to identify pinout and characteristics of various discrete semiconductors ( Transistors NPN, PNP, MOSFETs, etc ). It's also evaluating resistors, capacitors, inductances, etc... The original project was written in a mix of C and AVR Assembly Code for AVR gcc tooling AVR Studio.

f-Generator ( Selectable Frequency Square wave Output at TP 2 ) ( Test Pin 2 )

10-bit PWM ( Frequency with Selectable Duty Cycle Output at TP 2 )

Case you are lost in Menu, press the Arduino UNO reset key.
How to Use the Component Tester?

Connect component to test to any TP1, TP2, TP3 (component can be Transistors NPN, PNP, FET, Resistors, Capacitors, Diodes, LED and many more.)

Warning: TEST only capacitor you have discharged before !

Then press TEST push button and read the Test result on the 2 X 16 LCD.
Press TEST again to get more parameters or a new Test.

Long TEST pressing after a Test is done gives a Menu selection: press TEST again to scroll in menu selection, and press long TEST to select a specific function.
